Here's an explanation of the 2D arm robot python code:

The code begins by setting up the dimensions of the window and defining color constants. It also includes functions for calculating rotation and translation matrices.
Next, the Pygame library is initialized, and the window caption and size are set. A clock object is created to control the frame rate, and a flag called "done" is set to False to control the main game loop.
A function called "drawRectangle" is defined. It takes a rectangle, a transformation matrix, the screen, and a color as parameters. Inside the function, the rectangle is transformed using the matrix, and a filled rectangle with the specified color is drawn on the screen. Additionally, a black outline is added to the rectangle.
Two arrays, "rectangle1" and "rectangle2," are defined to represent the initial shape of the rectangles. These arrays contain the coordinates of the rectangle's vertices.
An identity matrix, "I," is created to serve as a reference matrix for transformations.
The variables "theta2" and "theta2_vel" are set to control the rotation of the second rectangle.
A background image is loaded and scaled to fit the desired dimensions.
The main game loop starts, where events are processed and the screen is updated until the "done" flag becomes True.
Inside the loop, the screen is filled with white color.
The background image is drawn on the screen at the specified position.
The "theta2" value is incremented to rotate the second rectangle.
A transformation matrix, "M1," is created to position and translate the first rectangle. The "drawRectangle" function is called to draw the first rectangle on the screen using the transformed matrix "M1."
Another transformation matrix, "M2," is created to rotate and position the second rectangle relative to the first one. The "drawRectangle" function is called again to draw the second rectangle on the screen using the transformed matrix "M2."
The display is updated to show the changes on the screen.
The clock regulates the frame rate to maintain a smooth animation.
Finally, the Pygame module is quit, and the program terminates.
