Here's an explanation of the modified code:

The code sets up the window dimensions and defines color constants.

The Rmat function calculates a rotation matrix based on the input degree.

The Tmat function creates a translation matrix based on the input x and y values.

Pygame is initialized, and the window caption and size are set.

The clock object is created to control the frame rate.

The done variable is set to False to control the main game loop.

The drawRectangle function takes a rectangle, a transformation matrix, the screen, and a color as parameters. It transforms the rectangle using the matrix, draws the filled rectangle with the specified color, and adds a black outline to the rectangle.

Two rectangle arrays, rectangle1 and rectangle2, are defined to represent the initial shape of the rectangles.

An identity matrix, I, is created to serve as a reference matrix for transformations.

The theta2 and theta2_vel variables are set to control the rotation of the second rectangle.

A background image is loaded and scaled to fit the desired dimensions.

The main game loop starts. It processes events and updates the screen until the done flag becomes True.

The screen is filled with white color.

The background image is drawn on the screen at the specified position.

The theta2 value is incremented to rotate the second rectangle.

The transformation matrix M1 is created to position and translate the first rectangle.

The drawRectangle function is called to draw the first rectangle with the transformed matrix M1.

The transformation matrix M2 is created to rotate and position the second rectangle relative to the first one.

The drawRectangle function is called to draw the second rectangle with the transformed matrix M2.

The display is updated.

The clock regulates the frame rate.

The Pygame module is quit to exit the program.
